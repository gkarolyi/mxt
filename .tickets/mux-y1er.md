# Use Cobra CLI framework for cleaner structure

Already planned for mxt implementation. This is tracked in Phase 1 of the mxt epic.

## Acceptance Criteria

mxt uses Cobra (already complete as part of feature parity work)


## Notes

**2026-02-26T05:49:31Z**

Verified CLI already uses Cobra (main.go defines cobra.Command with subcommands); acceptance criteria already satisfied, no code changes required.
