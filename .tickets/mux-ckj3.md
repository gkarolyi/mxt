# Use TOML (or other) for configuration format

Consider migrating from custom key=value format to TOML for better structure and validation. This is a breaking change and should wait until after feature parity.

## Acceptance Criteria

Config files use TOML format. Migration tool provided for existing configs. Documentation updated.
