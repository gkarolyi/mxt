# Fix feature parity discrepancies

Address any differences between mxt and muxtree output


## Notes

**2026-02-25T07:22:35Z**

Matched help/version/config/list output to muxtree; fixed config trailing newline and list trailing blank line; rebuilt mxt and harness checks pass for help/version/config/list.
