# Run complete feature spec test suite

Execute all feature specs and identify any discrepancies


## Notes

**2026-02-26T00:15:42Z**

Ran harness for help, version, init (via wrappers), config, new (basic + --run), list, delete, sessions open/close/relaunch. Sessions attach and terminal integration not run due to interactive attach/open requirements; needs manual verification.
